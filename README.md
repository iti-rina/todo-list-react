This repo contains the code for another ToDo-List. It is my first project that was developed using React library.\
I used the same styles as for the "todo-list-vanilla-JS" project.

![todo-list-interface](./docs/Interface.png?raw=true)

## Stack:

- React
- CSS

## To run the app:

1. Install node (node version of the project: 16.17.1)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. To run the project in the development mode: `npm start`

The project will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
